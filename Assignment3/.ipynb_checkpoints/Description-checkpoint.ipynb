    "the task is to get a general idea about content-based video retrieval. In the previous assignment, the audio information was used for retrieval purposes. In this task you will use the visual information of a video. You will get insights on visual feature extraction, applying similarity measures, shot cut detection, and how to perform meaningful classification for retrieval purposes. <br>\n",

    "An additional bonus task is provided to get some extra points. In the bonus task you will combine the extracted audio and video features to build a multimodal retrieval system. </p>\n",
