    "<li>In some tasks, you have to answer additional questions or provide a brief documentation of your progress in implementing specific algorithms or functions. For these questions, you may either use Jupyter Notebooks to answer them (use Markdown functionality for this) and provide example code (if needed), or do it in a standard PDF. Thus, the form of the report is entirely up to you.</li>\n",
