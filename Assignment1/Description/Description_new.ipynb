    "<li>Points will be deducted in case your source code is not&nbsp;<strong>properly documented</strong></li>\n",
    "<li>All tasks have to be solved in Python within Jupyter Notebooks.</li>\n",
    "<li>It is absolutely mandatory that you stick to the <strong>method signatures</strong> and that your functions output the results as indicated in the task descriptions</li>\n",
    "<li>You must be prepared for the discussion so that you can answer&nbsp;<strong>in-depth questions</strong>&nbsp;about your code and the implemented steps as well as about the underlying retrieval-related theories and concepts</li>\n",
    "<li>We strongly advise you&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;to use&nbsp;<strong>static paths</strong>&nbsp;in your implementations!</li>\n",
    "<li>Store your&nbsp;<strong>complete source code</strong>&nbsp;together with all files in&nbsp;<strong>one single zip-file</strong>&nbsp;the naming scheme of which could be found on the submission page and upload it&nbsp;<strong>before the deadline&nbsp;</strong>to the Moodle system</li>\n",
    "<li>In some tasks, you have to answer additional questions or provide a brief documentation of your progress in implementing specific algorithms or functions. For these questions, you may either use Jupyter Notebooks to answer them (use Markdown functionality for this) and provide example code (if needed), or do it in a standard PDF. Thus, the form of the report is entirely up to you.</li>\n",
    "<li>For each task, include an accordingly named Jupyter Notebook in your submission folder (e.g. Task1/Implementation.ipynb)</li>\n",
